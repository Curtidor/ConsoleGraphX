Welcome to ConsoleGraph-X, a minimalistic game engine designed to create retro-style games running on the Windows console. This project provides a foundation for game development in a nostalgic, text-based environment, reminiscent of classic titles from the past.

# Features
* **Console-Based:** Create games that run on the Windows console, delivering a retro gaming experience with a modern touch.

* **Component-based architecture (CBA):** A powerful entity-component system that efficiently manages game entities and their associated components.
  
* **Scripting System:** Add custom game logic using a powerful scripting system.

* **Sprite Rendering:** Display sprites and animations (WIP) with customizable layers for a polished visual presentation.

* **Scene System:** The scene system facilitates the organization and management of different game scenes, allowing for seamless transitions between levels, menus, and other sections of the game (WIP).
